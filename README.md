Pods Gravity Forms add-on
==================

Integration with Gravity Forms (http://www.gravityforms.com/); Provides a UI for mapping a Form's submissions into a Pod.

Please Note: This plugin is currently in alpha development, it does not have the UI to map the fields yet, however the code has been developed extensively already and we'll be providing examples of how to use it soon.
